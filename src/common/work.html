		Director and Secretary of <a href="http://lexdenmontessori.com/">Lexden Montessori Ltd.</a>, the family business.
		In these roles I have overseen, among other things,

		<ul class="inside">
		  <li>
		    <strong>Business planning.</strong>
		    From the outset I have been involved in the company&rsquo;s expansion and direction of growth.
		    I understand the requirements and challenges of a small business.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <strong>Market research and advertising</strong> in multiple media (print, web, radio, and others).
		    I have learned, by success and failure, how to think from a customer&rsquo;s perspective.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <strong>Administration and secretarial duties.</strong>
		    The follies of schematizing, sorting, and cross-referencing paperwork led me towards the real power of the computer.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <strong>Web design and maintenance</strong> for <a href="http://www.lexdenmontessori.com">http://www.<strong>lexdenmontessori.com</strong>/</a>.

		Branding for <a href="http://www.pembrokehouse.sc.ke/">Pembroke House (http://www.<strong>pembrokehouse.sc.ke</strong>/)</a>, a private Kenyan prep school.
		In the words of their Commercial Director:
		<blockquote style="font-size: 0.9em; padding: 1em 0 0.5em 2em;">
		  James has worked with me on new brand designs
		  for Harambee Schools Kenya, a charity
		  and Pembroke House school, a prep school.
		  In both cases his work was of the highest quality,
		  and reflected a passion for design,
		  but also for getting under the skin of the organisation he is designing for.
		  I wouldn't hesitate to use James again for any design projects that I might have.
