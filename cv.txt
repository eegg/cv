Skills

     * An impeccable grasp of the English language. I write for pleasure, and enjoy communicating ideas
       with flair, clarity and concision.
     * Organization. I manage my time and tasks effectively.
     * An eye for aesthetics, design, and presentation. I adore understated typography, functional

       simply in letter-writing.

       spreadsheets, presentations, and databases.
