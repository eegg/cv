   I am a perfectionist developer and designer currently completing an MSc in Computing Science. I am
   equally comfortable in the arts and the sciences. I like problems and will attack them until solved.
   I like to communicate in paint, print, and Python.

Skills

     * An understanding of algorithmics and a comfortableness with formalism. I am familiar with
       [4]Big‑O notation. I enjoy playing with and implementing algorithms for their own sake. I have an
       interest in [5]formal verification, which is the topic of my MSc individual project.
     * An impeccable grasp of the English language. I write for pleasure, and enjoy communicating ideas
       with flair, clarity and concision. I believe this is a prerequisite of being an effective
       programmer.
     * An eye for aesthetics, design, and presentation. I adore understated typography, functional
       communication, and interactive design. I not only apply these principles to documents I produce
       for print and for the web, but apply graphical and spatial thinking to general problem-solving.
     * Problem-solving and strategic thinking. I will thrive in an intellectually challenging workplace.
       I strive to eliminate routine tasks.
     * I have I.T. experience of the following, with varying familiarity:
          + Systems langs. ([6]C, [7]C++, [8]Go, [9]D)
          + Scripting langs. ([10]Python, [11]PHP)
          + Functional langs. ([12]Haskell)

          + Testing ([27]xUnit, [28]TDD)
          + [29]SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
          + [30]Photoshop, [31]The GIMP, [32]Inkscape
          + [33]T[E]X, [34]L^AT[E]X
          + [35]OpenOffice, [36]MS Office

       of growth. I understand the requirements and challenges of a small business.
