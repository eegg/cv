   I am a perfectionist developer and designer currently completing an MSc in Computing Science. I am
   equally comfortable in the arts and the sciences. I like problems and will attack them until solved.
   I like to communicate in paint, print, and Python.

Skills

     * An understanding of algorithmics and a comfortableness with formalism. I am familiar with Big-O
       notation. I enjoy playing with and implementing algorithms for their own sake. I have an interest
       in formal verification, which is the topic of my MSc individual project.
     * An impeccable grasp of the English language. I write for pleasure, and enjoy communicating ideas
       with flair, clarity and concision. I believe this is a prerequisite of being an effective
       programmer.
     * An eye for aesthetics, design, and presentation. I adore understated typography, functional
       communication, and interactive design. I not only apply these principles to documents I produce
       for print and for the web, but apply graphical and spatial thinking to general problem-solving.
     * Problem-solving and strategic thinking. I will thrive in an intellectually challenging workplace.
       I strive to eliminate routine tasks.
     * I have I.T. experience of the following, with varying familiarity:
          + Systems langs. (C, C++, Go, D)
          + Scripting langs. (Python, PHP)
          + Functional langs. (Haskell)
          + Javascript, CoffeeScript
          + jQuery, jQuery UI
          + Apache, NodeJS, MVC (Django)
          + HTML5, CSS3, XML, JSON, &c.
          + Revision control (git, svn)
          + Testing (xUnit, TDD)
          + SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
          + Photoshop, The GIMP, Inkscape
          + T[E]X, L^AT[E]X
